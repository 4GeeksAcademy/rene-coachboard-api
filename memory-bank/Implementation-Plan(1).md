# Implementation Plan ‚Äî AI Usage Guide

This document serves as a **living implementation record** for the project.  
It defines all planned and completed features, milestones, and technical steps required to reach and evolve the MVP.

---

## üß© AI Interaction Rules

1. **Always read this file before beginning any new feature or code change.**  
   Use it to understand what features exist, their current status, and dependencies.

2. **When adding a new feature:**
   - Duplicate the ‚ÄúFeature Implementation Plan Model‚Äù shown below.  
   - Replace all placeholder fields (`[Feature Name]`, etc.) with real details.  
   - Insert the new feature under the appropriate section (MVP, Post-MVP, or Other).  
   - Maintain consistent formatting.

3. **When updating progress:**
   - Update the **Status** field.  
   - Check off relevant items in **Implementation Steps** and **Acceptance Criteria**.  
   - Update the **Last Updated** date.  
   - If implementation details evolve, expand the ‚ÄúTechnical Breakdown‚Äù or ‚ÄúTesting Notes.‚Äù

4. **When completing a major milestone (e.g., MVP deployment):**
   - Add a short summary entry at the bottom under ‚ÄúDevelopment Notes‚Äù describing what changed or was achieved.

5. **Do not delete or overwrite past feature sections.**
   - Instead, mark them as ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù and update the timestamp.
   - This document should reflect a chronological record of development history.

## üöÄ MVP Features

### Feature: Authentication & Roles (Supabase Auth + Profiles)
**Purpose:**  
Establish secure login and role-aware access for **coach** and **player**, including team membership resolution.

**User Story / Use Case:**  
As a coach or player, I can authenticate via email/magic link/password and the app loads my teams and permissions.

**Dependencies / Prerequisites:**  
- Supabase project with Auth enabled  
- Tailwind 3.4, React, shadcn/ui  
- RLS enabled on all tables

**Technical Breakdown:**  
- Frontend: Login page, role capture modal on first login, session listener, route guards.  
- Backend/DB (Supabase): `profiles`, `teams`, `team_members`.  
- RLS: restrict selects/inserts/updates by `auth.uid()` membership and role.

**SQL (DDL):**
```sql
-- Profiles mirror for auth.users
create table if not exists public.profiles (
  user_id uuid primary key references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  full_name text,
  role text check (role in ('coach','player')),
  avatar_url text,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Teams and team membership
create table if not exists public.teams (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  sport text not null,
  coach_id uuid not null references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table if not exists public.team_members (
  team_id bigint references public.teams(id) on delete cascade,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  role_on_team text check (role_on_team in ('coach','assistant','player')) not null default 'player',
  jersey_number int,
  is_active boolean default true,
  primary key (team_id, user_id),
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- RLS
alter table public.profiles enable row level security;
alter table public.teams enable row level security;
alter table public.team_members enable row level security;

create policy "profiles are self-visible" on public.profiles
  for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "profiles are self-updatable" on public.profiles
  for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "team coach can select team" on public.teams
  for select using (coach_id = auth.uid());
create policy "member can select their team" on public.teams
  for select using (exists (
  select 1 from public.team_members tm where tm.team_id = id and tm.user_id = auth.uid()
));

create policy "members manage own membership" on public.team_members
  for select using (user_id = auth.uid() or exists (
    select 1 from public.teams t where t.id = team_id and t.coach_id = auth.uid()
  ));
```

**Implementation Steps:**  
- [ ] Build auth UI, session handling, and role capture.  
- [ ] Create RLS policies and test different roles.  
- [ ] Implement team membership loading in dashboard.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Users can log in and see their teams.  
- [ ] Coaches can see/manage their teams; players see only their own teams.  
- [ ] Unauthorized access is denied by RLS.

**Testing & Validation Notes:**  
Unit test hooks for session; RLS tests via PostgREST; Cypress e2e for route guards.

**Post-Implementation Actions:**  
Seed demo users/teams for previews.

for insert with check (
  user_id = auth.uid() and exists (select 1 from public.team_members tm where tm.team_id = availability.team_id and tm.user_id = auth.uid())
)
, for update using (
  user_id = auth.uid() or exists (select 1 from public.teams t where t.id = availability.team_id and t.coach_id = auth.uid())
);
```
